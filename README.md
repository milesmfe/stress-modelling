# Stress Modelling

## 1 Overview

This project looks to analyse physiological signal data from the [WESAD](https://ubi29.informatik.uni-siegen.de/usi/data_wesad.html) dataset. The main goal is to construct a model for stress behaviour, distinguishing between baseline, stress, amusement and meditation. The secondary goal is to use this model to gain further insight into human stress bahaviour. This could include distinguishing individual stress response characteristics from a baseline, identifying factors that affect individual stress responses most significantly, and identifying ideal methods for stress response reduction or mitigation.

Multiple models are constructed, each following a different architecture. However, a data preprocessing step is taken first to generate suitable feature vecotrs for training each model.
